# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description
This is my bootstrap portfolio project. It contains information about me, my work and how to contact me. This project is geared towards providing hands-on experience in html and css using frameworks, specifically bootstrap.

There were some challenges encountered during the build process including, what colors to use, where to place what and a few styling issues but with a little practice, all these challenges were meted out.
